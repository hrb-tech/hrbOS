We want to use https://github.com/rancher/elemental project resources for creating my own OS distribution, and also create a bootable pen-drive to install my own OS based in the elemental.

Answer: (skype copilot) 
That sounds like an exciting project! Here’s a concise guide to help you get started:  
Creating Your Own OS Distribution with Project Elemental
1. Set Up Your Environment:
•  Clone the Elemental Toolkit repository from GitHub: git clone https://github.com/rancher/elemental-toolkit.git.
•  Follow the setup instructions in the repository to configure your environment.

1. Build Your OS Image:  
•  Use the Elemental Toolkit to build your custom OS image. This involves creating a container image that includes all the necessary packages and configurations for your OS.  
•  Customize the OS by modifying the configuration files and adding any additional software you need.

2. Test Your OS Image:  
•  Before deploying, test your OS image in a virtual machine or a test environment to ensure everything works as expected.

Creating a Bootable Pen-Drive:  
1. Prepare the ISO File:
• Convert your custom OS image into an ISO file if it’s not already in that format.
2. Use a Tool to Create the Bootable Pen-Drive:  
• Rufus: A popular tool for creating bootable USB drives. Download Rufus, select your USB drive, choose the ISO file, and start the processhttps://rufus.ie/en/.  
•  Ventoy: Another tool that allows you to create a bootable USB drive by simply copying the ISO file to the USB drive. Ventoy supports multiple ISO files on a single USB drivehttps://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html.
3. Boot from the USB Drive:  
• Insert the USB drive into the target machine, restart it, and select the USB drive from the boot menu to start the installation process.  

By following these steps, you should be able to create your own OS distribution based on Project Elemental and install it using a bootable pen-drive.

Now, describe precisely what do I need to do on each step you provided in the latest answer.  

Answer: (skype copilot) 
Sure, let's break down each step in detail:
1. Set Up Your Environment
Clone the Elemental Toolkit Repository:
•  Open your terminal.  
•  Run the command: git clone https://github.com/rancher/elemental-toolkit.git.  
•  Navigate into the cloned directory: cd elemental-toolkit.  

2. Install Dependencies:  
•  Follow the setup instructions provided in the repository’s README file. This typically involves installing necessary tools and libraries, such as Docker, Go, and other dependencies.

3. Build Your OS Image
Create a Container Image:
• Use the Elemental Toolkit to define your OS image. This involves creating a Dockerfile or using existing templates provided in the toolkit.
• Customize the Dockerfile to include the packages and configurations you need for your OS.

4. Build the Image:
•  Run the build command specified in the toolkit’s documentation. For example: docker build -t my-custom-os ..
•  Ensure the build process completes without errors.

5. Customize Configuration Files:
•  Modify configuration files to set up your OS environment. This might include network settings, user accounts, and other system configurations.

Test Your OS Image
1. Set Up a Virtual Machine:
•  Use a virtualization tool like VirtualBox or VMware.
•  Create a new virtual machine and configure it to use the OS image you built.

2. Boot the Virtual Machine:
•  Start the virtual machine and ensure it boots correctly from your custom OS image.
•  Test all functionalities to make sure everything works as expected.

Prepare the ISO File
1. Convert to ISO:  
•  If your OS image is not already in ISO format, use a tool like mkisofs to create an ISO file. For example: mkisofs -o my-custom-os.iso /path/to/os/files.

Use a Tool to Create the Bootable Pen-Drive
1. Download and Install Rufus:
•  Go to the Rufus website and download the latest version.
•  Install Rufus on your computer.

Create the Bootable USB Drive:
•  Insert your USB drive into your computer.
•  Open Rufus, select your USB drive, and choose the ISO file you created.
•  Click "Start" to create the bootable USB drive.

Boot from the USB Drive
1. Insert the USB Drive:  
•  Plug the USB drive into the target machine.
2. Access the Boot Menu:
•  Restart the machine and enter the boot menu (usually by pressing a key like F12, Esc, or Del during startup).
3. Select the USB Drive:
•  Choose the USB drive from the boot menu options.
•  Follow the on-screen instructions to install your custom OS.

By following these detailed steps, you should be able to create your own OS distribution based on Project Elemental and install it using a bootable pen-drive.

Second Answer (cody sourcegraph assistent chat):  
I'll help create the necessary configuration for your custom OS based on elemental-toolkit. Let's break this down into actionable steps with specific code:
First, let's clone the elemental-toolkit:  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/rancher/elemental-toolkit.git
cd elemental-toolkit
```  
2. create a custom configuration file for your OS:  
```yaml  
name: "hrbOS"
version: "1.0.0"
base_image: "opensuse/leap:15.4"

packages:
  - docker
  - docker-compose
  - portainer
  - curl
  - wget
  - git

services:
  enabled:
    - docker
    - portainer

post_install:
  commands:
    - systemctl enable docker
    - docker run -d -p 9000:9000 --name=portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce
```  
3. crete the build configuration:  
```yaml  
image:
  repository: "hrb/os"
  tag: "latest"

iso:
  filename: "hrbOS.iso"
  label: "HRBOS_INSTALL"
  
boot:
  cmdline: "console=tty1 root=LABEL=COS_STATE"
```  
4. build the OS image:  
```bash  
elemental build --config config/build.yaml
```  
5. create the bootable ISO:  
```bash  
elemental iso --config config/build.yaml
```  
6. write the ISO to a USB drive (replace /dev/sdX with your USB device):  
```bash  
sudo dd if=hrbOS.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync
dd if=build/hrbOS.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
```  

The resulting bootable USB will contain:

* Base OS with Docker pre-installed
* Docker Compose ready to use
* Portainer running on port 9000
* Automatic service startup on boot

To use the bootable drive:
1. Insert the USB drive
2. Boot from USB
3. Follow the installation wizard
4. After installation, the system will boot with Docker and Portainer ready to use

Key features of your custom OS:  
* Minimal base system focused on container workloads
* Pre-configured Docker environment
* Web-based container management through Portainer
* Automated service initialization
* Persistent storage configuration for containers
  
The installation process will create a robust environment specifically designed for running containerized applications, meeting the goals specified in your README.md file.  
  
Remember to replace /dev/sdX with your actual USB device path when writing the ISO. You can find the correct device path using:  
```bash
lsblk
```  
This will list all available block devices, including your USB drive.
